# Contributing

## Code of conduct

Please note that by participating in this project, you agree to abide by its [code of conduct][coc]. That is true for any aspect of the project, online or offline.

## Code review

I'm always learning! You're welcome to open a _pull request_ to walk me through any refactoring that would help me learn about:

- making the code more idiomatic
- making the code safer (from a security point of view)
- anything else that you find relevant!

## Copyright and licensing

When adding or modifying files, please make sure you append the appropriate copyright and licensing information to their licensing headers. I can help with that if you're unsure about how to proceed.

## Authorship

When adding contributing, please add yourself to:

- the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS.md) list
- and the list in [`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`](src-tauri/Cargo.yml) when relevant

Those file are not used for licensing purposes, but for giving credit where it is due â€” for example, in the "about" section of the application. (If you're working for an organization, you can add your name if you want, even if the copyright headers are in that organization's name.)
